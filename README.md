# Basic-3x3-Led-cube
this is where you can download some basic code for 3x3 led cubes powered by arduino 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CODE IS IN NO WAY PERFECT, I AM STILL RELATIVLY NEW TO ARDUINO, BUT THIS CODE IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AND CAN BE ADAPTED TO WORK WITH MENY DIFFRENT CUBES VERY EASALY 

AND YES MY SPELLING IS AWFUL, GITHUB LACKS SPELL CHECK DEAL WITH IT
